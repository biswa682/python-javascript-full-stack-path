	Build a hierarchical, navigable tree structure using jQuery. The tree structure should be at least 3 levels deep.

	For example:

	Depth 0
	-- Depth 1
	-- Depth 2

	It should expand and minimize to reveal and hide nested nodes. Do not use an existing library to build the tree structure.

	Please use the IPL dataset that you had previously used for the Visualisation assignment. An example hierarchy could be

	Year > Team > Players

	When the last entity is selected, show a stat relevant to that identity on the page. This can either be a visualisation or a table.
